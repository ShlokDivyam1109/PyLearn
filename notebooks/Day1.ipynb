    "According to Guido Van Rossum (Creator of Python!!!), Python is \"a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers\". Python is a high-level (doesn't mean it is difficult to understand), general purpose programming language . Python is easy. Quite easier than assumed to be. It was first developed in December 1989, and was named Python, just because Van Rossum was a big fan of Monty's Python Flying Circus!\n",

    "Before we hop onto full-fledged coding, let us understand the basics of python language that we may require while coding. The most important of all, Python is a programming language, not a simple communication language that a simple mistake can be handled without any interventions. Python is case-sensitive, i.e., it can differentiate between a capital and a small letter. Hence, the syntax must not have any spelling mistakes, not even case mistake. Secondly, Python doesn't have any \"line break character\" way of differentiating different lines of codes. Hence, we must go to \"next lines\" and use \"tab spaces\" judiciously. Why and when do we provide tab space? Imagine you have written a code to do work 1 and 2 if a condition is true, else, just skip to the main part where we must do work 2."

    "There are some basic programming terms that we must keep in mind before we start to program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Variables: These are certain name given to a value, so that it can be used later on in the code. In more complex words, it is a memory space defined to store values provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1) Variable type: Memory space provided may vary based on what are the values provided. Type of variables are the sub groups of variables that we define to store values. It describes the characteristics of what the variable contains, whether it is a single character, a set of characters, an integer, a decimal number, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.1) int: This variable type stores the integer values, for example, 1234, -437, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.2) float: This variable type stores the decimal values, for example, 1234.5678, -437.196, etc. (Note: when a float is defined, it will have a roundoff error due to lack of precision)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.3) double: This variable type stores the decimal values, but has size double than that of float, for example, 1234.56786243, -437.192736431, etc. (Note: Same error as floats)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.4) str: This variable type stores a set of characters, for example, 'Hello','World',etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.5) bool: This variable either stores True or False (Case sensitive). For example, 1>2 stored in a variable makes the value of the variable True.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.6) None: This variable type is when a variable contains nothing. For example, if you want to assign some value to a variable later on, and have defined it beforehand, we assign *None*(Case sensitive) value to the variable. ex: a = None.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.7) list/arrays: This variable stores a set of different values. It can store int, float, double, str, list, arrays, etc. but has a defined positioning system. these position are called index. Index starts from 0, and goes to n-1, where n is the length of the list. Python allows back counting, i.e., last index can be represented as -1, seond last as -2, etc. For example, if [1,2,3.14,\"Hello\"] is defined to be a list and assigned to a variable named var, since the objects to be stored are entered in '[]' separated by ',', var will automatically assume the datatype list. Now, the value 1 is at index 0, 2 is at index 1, etc. and can be called with var[0], var[1], etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.8) tuple: This variable type is same as list, but with a slight difference. Values stored in this variable can never be changed!\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.9) set: This variable type is same as list, but, just like real sets, it does not contain duplicate items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable types are automatically assigned by python to the variables during assignment. Pre-defining of variables are not mandatory here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tx = 12\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of code will store the value of int \"12\" into the space allocated for variable x, automatically assigning int type to x. But if I try to change its value to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tx = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of code will store the values \"[1,2,3,4]\" into the space allocated for variable x, overwriting the value \"12\", automatically assigning list type to x. Hence, \"12\" would be lost!\n",
