# ImMortal ♥️ Python

Author: Shlok Divyam
Project: Learning to Code in Python
Description: In this simple project, I will be teaching how to use Python Programming for beginners. I have divided this project into several different parts for reader's ease. Please complete only one Jupyter notebook per day. Also try to solve the questions given at the end of each notebooks to be able to apply the concepts learned. The Jupyter notebooks are stored in the "notebooks" folder.

I am just a young guy who has recently started to write on social platforms. I apologize for any inconvenience caused, or mistakes done. Please help me to improve this project by starring, commenting, and sharing it with many people. It would be greatly appreciated!
